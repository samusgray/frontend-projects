FrontEnd Projects: Practical projects to master applicable skills.
===

Frontend & Node.js micro-project ideas that challenge specific skills.

Each project should meet the following criteria:

1. Focus on a small collection of features that will almost certainly be
required in a quality, production web application.
2. Identify two or three skills targeted in the challenge
3. Refrence any prerequisites or skills needed to complete the challenge
and learn the targeted skills
4. All prerequisites must be attainable through projects listed as a
project in this repo. If it doesn't exist, then make it. 
5. Relevant, free materials & resources should be listed with each
project.

# Draft Project Outline:
(These are not yet ordered or linked together according to the above
standards. )

## JavaScript
- Find a javascript (or jQuery) pluggin that doesn't have tests. Fork
  the repo and write tests with Jasmine. Bonus: Send a pull request to
the source repo once a few tests are complete.
- Find an API at http://www.programmableweb.com/ and use AJAX to display
  content in your own archive. Bonus: Use a templating language like
handle bars to display data
- Refactor a jQuey plugin to eliminate the jQuery depenency.
- Use Google Maps API and HTML5 Geo Location to show a client's current
  location. Bonus: Use web sockets to track and update the map in real
time.
- Write a utility that generates a randomized, decorative background for
  any block level element.
- HTML5 Form that saves progress to locaal storage as the user fills it
  out. Bonus: Post data to NoSQL database when the user submits the
form.
- Refactor a terrible script. Bonus: Use coffeescript.

## CSS & Design
- Given two divs, write CSS to arrange as columns in as many ways as you
  can think of. Bonus: Descibe pros and cons of each method in
paragraphs within each implimentation.
- Build a simple, responsive dropdown-menu.
- Build a readable, responsive blog post. Focus on redability and
  responsive content. Bonus: Determine best practice for responsive
images and include a featured image.
- Style a custom Google Map with Google Maps API. Examples at
  snazzymaps.com
- Refactor a terrible stylesheet. Bonus: Use Sass and write a mixin to
  reduce repetition.

# Todo:
- Create project templates according to archive values.
- Add dificulty tags to each project.
